# BlockchainIntegrityVerifier

## Description

A distributed ledger framework utilizing a novel Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm, integrating zero-knowledge proof-based privacy protocols and optimized for IoT device interoperability.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for a software project about BlockchainIntegrityVerifier:
- "Validates transaction hashes using SHA256 and BLAKE2b cryptographic algorithms",
- "Performs realtime smart contract auditing with static code analysis and dependency graphing",
- "Detects and alerts on potential 51% attacks and other network security breaches",
- "Supports integration with multiple blockchain networks via modular plugin architecture",
- "Conducts automated testing and verification of blockchain node configurations",
- "Provides tamperevident ledger storage with Merkle treebased data structures",
- "Offers configurable alerting and notification systems for integrity breaches and anomalies"
- Let me know if you'd like me to generate more!
